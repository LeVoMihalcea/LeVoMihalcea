### Hi there 👋

People usually call me Leo
I'm a Junior Software Developer focused on building maintainable Spring-Boot applications.
I'm currently in my last year studying Programming at Babes-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca

I'm usually building web-applications with the following stack: 

  For the backend I use Spring-Boot 🍃 most of the time 
  
  The front-end is done in Angular 
  
  The database is running on a Postgres Server 

As of writing this text, I'm also learning Continious Deployment from scratch while toying around with a Raspberry Pi 🍓 (sorry, I did not find a raspberry emoji)
